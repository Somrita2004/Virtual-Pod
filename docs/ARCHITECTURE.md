# Virtual Pod Architecture

## System Overview

Virtual Pod implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concepts to simulate a complete software development lifecycle.

## Core Components

### 1. Multi-Agent System
- **BaseAgent**: Foundation class for all specialized agents
- **Project Lead Agent**: Orchestrates the development process
- **Business Analyst Agent**: Requirements analysis and user story generation
- **Designer Agent**: UI/UX design and system architecture
- **Developer Agent**: Code generation and implementation
- **Tester Agent**: Test case creation and validation

### 2. RAG Enhancement
- **Context Storage**: Browser-based storage for project artifacts
- **Template Matching**: Intelligent template selection and adaptation
- **Feedback Loops**: Iterative improvement based on user input

### 3. User Interface
- **Tab-based Navigation**: Intuitive phase management
- **Real-time Updates**: Live agent status and progress tracking
- **Artifact Management**: Comprehensive artifact viewing and export
